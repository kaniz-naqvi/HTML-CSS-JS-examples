    <h1>Nature Lovers Image Gallery</h1>

    <p>This project demonstrates how styling with CSS and the interactivity provided by JavaScript can transform a simple HTML webpage into a dynamic and engaging user experience. It highlights how these technologies can bring life to a website and provide a much richer user interface.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, I have designed an image gallery to showcase the power of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>HTML</b> - The basic structure of the website.</li>
      <li><b>CSS</b> - Adding styles to improve the layout and design.</li>
      <li><b>JavaScript</b> - Introducing interactivity such as dynamic image changes, fullscreen view, and navigation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <h3>1. HTML-only Version</h3>
    <p><a href="html.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to view how the website looks using only HTML. Itâ€™s basic and functional but lacks any styling or interactivity.</p>

    <h3>2. Styled Version (Using CSS)</h3>
    <p><a href="css/css.html" target="_blank">Explore here</a> to see the same website after applying CSS. Minor styling enhances the overall look, making it more appealing and easy to navigate.</p>

    <h3>3. Interactive Version (Using JavaScript)</h3>
    <p><a href="js/gallery.html" target="_blank">Explore here</a> to experience how JavaScript brings interactivity into the website. Features like image swapping, fullscreen view, and image navigation make the gallery much more dynamic and engaging.</p>

    <h2>How to Explore</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>HTML:</b> View the basic structure and see how simple HTML lays the foundation for any webpage.</li>
      <li><b>CSS:</b> See how even minimal CSS can improve the design, making it more user-friendly and visually pleasing.</li>
      <li><b>JavaScript:</b> Discover how JavaScript enhances functionality, making the site interactive with dynamic features such as image changes, navigations, and fullscreen viewing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project emphasizes how combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can vastly improve the user experience, making a website not only functional but also visually engaging and interactive. By using these technologies effectively, we can take a basic web page and transform it into something that is both enjoyable to use and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
